# JS-Timer-App

This was part of a bootcamp run by Colt Steele and Stephen Grider. Created a timer app from scratch using JS, HTML, and CSS.

This project helped me learn how to logically think through the process of developing an app, from the initial planning to connecting all the pieces together.

I added additional functionalities to reset on user input and to reset on completion.
